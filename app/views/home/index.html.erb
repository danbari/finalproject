<h1>Welcome to Weed Coffee Roasting</h1>
<p>Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Happy painting, God bless. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Just beat the devil out of it.</p>

<p>This is the fun part Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it one canvas. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p>

<p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. You're meant to have fun in life.</p>

<p>The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.</p>

<p>The least little bit can do so much. Let's do it again then, what the heck. In life you need colors. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.</p>

<p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. I like to beat the brush.</p>

<p>Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>
