<p>Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Everybody needs a friend. Do an almighty painting with us. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.</p>

<p>All kinds of happy little splashes. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it one canvas. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.</p>

<p>Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>

<p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. There are no limits in this world. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Let's do it again then, what the heck.</p>

<p>It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.</p>

<p>See there how easy that is. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Now then, let's play. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.</p>

<p>This piece of canvas is your world. I like to beat the brush. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Nothing wrong with washing your brush It's important to me that you're happy. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.</p>
